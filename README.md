## Attribution and Additions
This repo represents a very abridged and limited version of [Fast Style Transfer in Pytorch](https://github.com/rrmina/fast-neural-style-pytorch). Most code remains as is, with minor additions as needed:

1. Addition of contrastive loss
2. Embedding contrastive loss in original training/plotting code

The train function from train.py in original code has been moved to train_pipeline.py as a training class for ease of running experiments with different experiments.
