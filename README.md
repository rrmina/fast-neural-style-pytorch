# Fast Neural Style Transfer with contrastive Loss


## Attribution and Additions
This repo represents a very abridged and limited version of [Fast Style Transfer in Pytorch](https://github.com/rrmina/fast-neural-style-pytorch). The original readme, with implementation and paper details has been moved [ORIGINAL_README.md](https://github.com/sunny1401/Fast-neural-style-transfer-with-contrastive-loss/blob/master/ORIGINAL_README.md) Most code remains as is, with minor additions as needed:

1. Addition of contrastive loss (loss_functions.py).
2. Embedding contrastive loss in original training/plotting.py with the train function from train.py in original code has been moved to train_pipeline.py (train_pipeline.py).
3. Minor data sturctures for ease of running/tracking experiments with different experiments (train_utils.py/utils.py).
